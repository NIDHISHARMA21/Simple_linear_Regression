Simple Linear regression Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.

Simple linear regression problem no 1.

A certain food based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness company spread across the country to find relationship between a person’s weight gain and the no of calories consumed by them in order to come up a diet plan for individuals that fall under different weight groups. Approach - A Simple Linear regression model needs to be built with target variable ‘Calories.Consumed’.

In this problem we have to record RMSE values, Correlation coefficient values for different transform models.

Business objective: To find the correlation coefficient values.

Constraints: 1.Estimate the parameters of the model. 2.Perform statistical inferences on these parameters.
